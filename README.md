###Wed TechTalk Todos
Ok guys, a serious readme for now, i messed up at the time of the presentation, here is the source code, it's not the best practice or anything, it is just a very simple show of AngularJS power, please feel free to contact me to further understand what i've done or why i've done it within this sourcecode. 


if you found this repo by "chance" and would like to contact me you can ping me @ramigb.

ps: if you don't want to modify the HTML5 mode and want this to work out of the box, just clone this repo inside http://localhost/techtalk and make sure apache modrewrite is enabled so the .htaccess file could work.
